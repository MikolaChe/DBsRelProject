# DBsRelProject
Commission payment system. A client comes from a third-party company, and you need to accept payment in a closed SGLite, and 10% goes to outsourcing, for security reasons, we do not give him access to our database. The code immediately after writing the payment to our database imports the outsourcing fee data into an external MongoDB database.
